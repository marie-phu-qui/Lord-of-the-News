# Lord-of-the-News

Enjoy the regular news narrated by J.R. Tolkien. Because world state is more entertaining when there are hobbits around.

## Focus on :
Machine learning and neural networks are our focus. Our goal is to be able to transform a text of dry news to a beautiful J.R. Tolkien style narrative. 
Based in Wellington, New Zealand our team has a time frame of 8 days to catch up on machine learning tools to build a real time (based on Google news) news app transpilled to Lord of the Ring style. 

## We want more - can we do more ? :
- We enjoy Lord of the ring so much and our AI is such a talented writter - the whole web should be such a pleasure to read.
  - Say no more - we intend to be building a Chrome extension to transpile every bit of english sentence to this enjoyable adventure.

- Elvish is great - Tolkien is also the whole building of another language, talent, greatness... I want to see elvish on my screen and I want it as Tolkien would have done it. Lord of the News can you do it ?
  - We sure can try to bring it to you. We will be stretching our AI to detect foreign language (not english) on your page to be of elvishish beauty. 

## Planning
# Team
- Expectations
- Work Styles : 
  Nat : home codeur
  Kyoko & Marie : 9am - 8pm codeurs. We will split research in teams of ones. We acknoledge that we are more efficient are a fluid team with pairing opportunities on harder to tackle challenges.
- Personalities snippet
- Declarations : Remember to ask for help before the problem becomes painful. Don't stay stuck. Take breaks. Keep it entertaining. Learn the tech.

# Team Focus
- Project Owner : Marie
- Git Master : Kyoko
- Fun Keeper : Nat

# Project Planning
- MVP
  - The API does change the text to a Lord of the Ring narrative that is still fitting in english conformity. 
- Planning
  - Wednesday
    Research : \
        - Natural Language Processing tool  : <a href='https://github.com/spencermountain/compromise'>Compromise</a> \
        - Open source machine learning framework  : <a href='https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow'>Tensorflow</a>\
        - Machine learning Software  : Weka, develloped by the University of Waikato\
        - Creative AI to write horror stories  : <a href='http://shelley.ai/'>Shelley</a>, by the MIT media team \
        - Other Text AI : <a href='http://fido.ai/'>FIDO.AI</a> is an AI created to detect cyberbullying violence between children online, this is important to us to help carry meaning in our news;  <a href='https://textio.com/'>TEXTIO</a>, predict the expected response to a text(positive/negative) - <i>less meaningful to our project goal</i>;  <a href='https://www.cortical.io/'>CORTICAL</a>, is an AI which processes Natural Language Understanding - it goes from language detection (for our elvish strech) - to Twitter filters;  <a href='https://narrativescience.com/'>NARRATIVE SCIENCE</a>, has a strong company driven approch, this transforms data to text - <i>less meaningful to our project goal</i>.\
