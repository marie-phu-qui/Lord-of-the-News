        <h2>Our Focus: </h2>
        <p>
          Machine learning and neural networks. We want to transform a text of dry news to J.R. Tolkien style narrative. Based in Wellington, New Zealand our team has a time frame of 8 days to catch up on machine learning tools to build a real time (based on Google news) news app transpilled to Lord of the Ring style.

        <p>
          We enjoy Lord of the ring so much and our AI is such a talented writer - the whole web should be such a pleasure to read.
          We intend to build a Chrome extension to transpile every bit of english sentence to this enjoyable adventure.
          We want to see elvish on the screen and as Tolkien would have done it.
          We will be stretching our AI to detect foreign language (not english) on your page to be of elvish beauty.
